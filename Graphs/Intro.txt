The node is called as vertex in graph. 
The line connecting 2 vertices is called edge or connection.

There is no limit to how many other vertices that a vertex can connect to.

The edges can be weighted or non weighted. They can also be directional or bidirectional.

Trees are a form of graphs, but they have the limitation that each node can only point to 2 other nodes.

Linked lists are a form of a tree. Therefore, a linked list is a form of a graph with the limitation that they can only point to one 
other node.
