It is very similar to a binary search tree and it is a binary tree.

Each node has a number that is higher than all of its descendants, which means the highest value will always be at the top.
There's no particular order other than all of the descendants are going to be less than or equal to the item at the top.
So heaps are not good for searching.

A key characteristic of a heap is that it is a complete tree.

Another difference of a heap from a binary search tree is that you can have duplicates.

A max heap has highest value at the top.
A min heap has minimum value at the top.

The only thing you use a heap for is being able to keep track of the largest item at the top, and be able to quickly remove it.

Heap is stored in a list and node class is not created.

There are two common ways of storing the heap in a list.
The first way is to store the first item at the index of zero.
The second and most common way is to store the first item at the index of one.

Left child = 2 * parent index
Right child = 2 * parent index +1
