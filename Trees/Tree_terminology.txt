Leaf / External node - The nodes which don't have any child nodes
Edge  = An edge connects 2 nodes to show there is a relationship between them
Ancestor of a node - Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root node to that node
Descendant of a node - Any successor nodes on the path of the leaf node to that node
Level of a node / Depth of a tree - The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. Root node has level 0
Height of a tree - The count of edges on the path from the root node to the most distant leaf node. Most distant leaf node has height 0
Internal node - A node with atleast 1 child node
Neighbour node - Parent or child of that node
Sibling node - Nodes which have same parent node
