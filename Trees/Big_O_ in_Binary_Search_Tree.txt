Maximum no.of nodes in a binary search tree = 2^n - 1, where n - no.of levels in the tree 
lookup(), insert() and remove() methods has a time compelexity of O(logn) in binary search trees
lookup() and remove() methods has a time compelexity of O(n) in linked list
insert(), which is append() method, has a time complexity of O(1) in linked list

Hence, it is efficient to use lookup() and remove() method using binary search tree, and use insert() method using linked list

No datastructure is efficient for all situations. Hence, we have to use different datastructure depending on the sitiuation for better time complexity
