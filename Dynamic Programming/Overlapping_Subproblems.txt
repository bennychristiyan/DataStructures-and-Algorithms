There are two things that are required for something to be able to use dynamic programming. The first requirement is Overlapping subproblems and
the second requirement is Optimized substructure

Overlapping subproblems are subproblems of a main problem, among which some subproblems are identical to others

Say, SP1 has trillion operations and returns a value 10; we can store the value 10 in a list, say, at index 1. Say, another SP is identical to SP1, 
instead of repeating the trillion operations, we can use the value 10 at index 1. This makes the time complexity for the identical SP as O(1). 
Hence, this is very time efficient.

The process of storing the answers of these subproblems is called MEMOIZATION

We repeat the above process, for all subproblems. And finally we combine the answers of the subproblems to obtain the answer of the main problem

Merge sort is not an Overlapping subproblem as it doesn't have any identical subproblems
