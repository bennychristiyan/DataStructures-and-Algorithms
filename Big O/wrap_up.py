# if n = 100; O(1) = 1, O(log_n) = 7, O(n) = 100, O(n^2) = 10000
# if n = 1000; o(1) = 1, O(log_n) = 10, O(n) = 1000, O(n^2) = 1000000
# as the value of n increases, O(1) always remains 1. Hence it is very efficient
# as the value of n increases, O(log_n) changes slightly. 
# as the value of n increases, O(n) will be equal to n
# as the value of n increases, O(n^2) will be square of n. Hence it is very inefficient
