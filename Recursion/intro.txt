Recursion is a function that calls itself until it doesn't.

The process of whatever we're doing with recursion has to be the same.
Each time we use recursion, we make the problem smaller.

If a condition inside the recursive function is satisfied, it returns something and the function stops calling itself, it is called a 
base case. 
If it needs to call itself again, it is called a recursive case.

If there is not any return statement (base case) in the recursive function, it creates infinite no. of instances and causes a condition 
called stack overflow. You cannot simply put print statement instead of return statement

The condition inside the recursive function must become true at some point
